# QuantEd (final deluxe build)
Static site ready for GitHub Pages.

- Upload everything in this folder to the **root** of your `QuantEd` repo (keep your existing project folders with images).
- Make sure project images live at `/projects/<ID>/results/*.png` and reports at `/projects/<ID>/<report>.pdf`.
- `index.html` is the landing page. CSS is in `/assets/styles.css`.
