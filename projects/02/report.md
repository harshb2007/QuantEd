# PROJECT-02 — Portfolio Optimization with Efficient Frontier
**Objective**: Modern Portfolio Theory with mean–variance, risk parity, and constraints; plots efficient frontier and allocation.

**Skills & Methods**: Numpy, Optimization, Matplotlib

**Key Findings (Placeholder)**
- Replace with actual metrics (Sharpe, CAGR, Max Drawdown).
- Insert screenshots/plots.

**Repro Steps**
1. Describe dataset & parameters.
2. Steps to run code.
3. How to reproduce plots and tables.

**Education Note**
Shows how diversification shapes drawdowns and Sharpe.
